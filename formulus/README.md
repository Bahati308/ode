This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### Now what?

- If you want to add this new React Native code to an existing application, check out the [Integration guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps).

# WebView Assets Setup

This project includes custom WebView assets that need to be available to the Android app. Here's how the setup works:

## Asset Location
- Source files are located in `assets/webview/`
- These files are automatically copied during the build process

## Android Configuration

The Android build is configured to:
1. Copy webview assets during the build process
2. Make them available at `file:///android_asset/webview/` in the WebView

## Accessing Assets in Code

Reference the assets in your React Native code like this:

```typescript
const INJECTION_SCRIPT_PATH = Platform.OS === 'ios' 
  ? 'FormulusInjectionScript.js' 
  : 'file:///android_asset/webview/FormulusInjectionScript.js';
```

## Generating the injection script
The injection script is autogenerated based on the src\webview\FormulusInterfaceDefinition.ts file. To generate the injection script, run the following command:

```bash
npm run generate
```

## Development Notes
- When adding new files to `assets/webview/`, ensure they are included in the build by:
  1. Running a clean build: `cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..`
  2. Rebuilding the app: `npx react-native run-android`

## Synchronization considerations

This section describes the design strategy for synchronizing both *observation records* and their associated *attachments* in the ODE sync protocol.

The key principle is **decoupling metadata sync (observations) from binary payload sync (attachments)** to keep the protocol robust, offline-friendly, and simple to implement.

---

### Two-phase sync

We separate sync into two distinct phases:

- **Phase 1: Observation data sync**
  - Uses the existing `/sync/pull` and `/sync/push` endpoints.
  - Syncs only the observation records as JSON (including references to attachment IDs in their `data`).

- **Phase 2: Attachment file sync**
  - Upload or download attachment files *after* a successful observation sync.
  - Handles binary data transfers independently.

---

### Immutable attachments

- Attachments are **immutable**: once uploaded, they cannot change.
- If an attachment needs to be updated, a new GUID/filename is generated and stored in the observation’s `data`.
- This design prevents conflicts and simplifies syncing.

---

### Local attachment tracking table

To optimize client sync and avoid repeatedly checking the entire observation database, the client maintains a **local table** (e.g. in SQLite or WatermelonDB):

#### Suggested schema:

| Column          | Type      | Description                                      |
|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| attachment_id    | String    | Unique ID (e.g. GUID + extension)                |
| direction        | String    | Either `'upload'` or `'download'`                |
| synced           | Boolean   | True if successfully uploaded/downloaded         |
| last_attempt_at  | Timestamp | Optional, for retry logic                        |
| error_message    | String    | Optional, records the last error if any          |

This table is **client-local only**; the server remains agnostic about the client's attachment sync state.

---

### Upload flow

- When a new observation is saved locally and references a new attachment:
  - Insert a row in the attachment tracking table with `direction = 'upload'` and `synced = false`.

- The client attachment uploader runs periodically:
  - Queries for `direction = 'upload' AND synced = false`.
  - For each record:
    - Checks that the local file exists.
    - Uploads it to the server.
    - Marks `synced = true` on success.

---

### Download flow

- After completing `/sync/pull`, the client receives new or updated observations.
- It parses the `data` field of those records to extract referenced attachment IDs.
- For each attachment ID:
  - Checks if it's already present locally.
  - If missing, inserts into the tracking table with `direction = 'download'` and `synced = false`.

- The client attachment downloader runs periodically:
  - Queries for `direction = 'download' AND synced = false`.
  - For each record:
    - Downloads the file from the server.
    - Stores it locally.
    - Marks `synced = true` on success.

---

### Advantages of this design

- Keeps observation sync and attachment transfer logically separate.  
- Allows partial or incremental attachment sync.  
- Supports offline-first workflows.  
- Minimizes redundant network checks (no repeated HEAD calls).  
- Enables efficient batching and retry strategies.  
- Server remains stateless regarding which attachments the client has.

---

### Future enhancements

This approach can evolve to support:

- Hash-based deduplication.  
- Server-side manifests of missing attachments.  
- Bucketed storage layout for server files.  
- Presigned URLs for cloud storage.  
- Attachment lifecycle policies (e.g. pruning old unused files).  
- Per-table or per-schema-type attachment sync versions.

This strategy ensures the MVP implementation is **simple yet robust** while leaving the door open for sophisticated future features.
