# Synkronus

**Synkronus** is a lightweight, offline-first sync API designed to support the `Collective` app ecosystem. It enables reliable synchronization of structured form data, app bundles, and file attachments in constrained environments. Built with modularity, performance, and FLOSS values in mind.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- **Offline-first**: Built to work in unreliable or offline environments
- **Modular**: Clean API for syncing data, files, and custom app bundles
- **FLOSS**: Fully open source stack, self-hostable and auditable
- **Lean & fast**: Minimal runtime dependencies, Docker-friendly
- **Custom sync protocol**: Avoids the complexity and rigidity of CouchDB replication
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication with simple role-based access
