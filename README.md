# Open Data Ensemble (ODE) üéº

Welcome to the **Open Data Ensemble** - a comprehensive platform for mobile data collection and synchronization! 

## About ODE

ODE is a monorepo containing all the core components in the ODE universe - the essential members of our *ensemble*, if you will. We're building a modern, open-source solution for field data collection that works seamlessly across mobile devices and web platforms.

## Architecture

This repository houses four main components:

### **formulus**
A React Native project containing the code for Android and iOS apps. This is your mobile data collection companion, designed for field work and offline-first data gathering.

### **formulus-formplayer**
A React web application responsible for rendering JSON forms and communicating with the Formulus mobile app. It provides the dynamic form interface that powers your data collection workflows.

### **synkronus**
The server component written in Go. This handles data synchronization, storage, and provides the backbone for all data operations across the platform.

### **synkronus-cli**
A command-line utility to interact with the Synkronus server. Use it to manage custom app data, handle user administration, export data to Parquet format, and perform various administrative tasks.

## We're Young & Fresh! üå±üå±üå±

ODE is a **young and vibrant open-source project**, and we're incredibly welcoming to contributors of all experience levels and interests! Whether you're passionate about:
